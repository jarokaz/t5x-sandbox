# T5X on Vertex AI

This repository compiles prescriptive guidance and code samples demonstrating how to operationalize open source large language models with T5X on Vertex AI.

The content in this repository centers around these scenarios:
 - Data preprocessing with SeqIO and Apache Beam 
 - Pre training and fine tuning models developed with open source T5X framework on Vertex AI. 
 - Online and batch serving large language models developed with T5X on Vertex AI. 
 - Automating training and deployment process for large language models using Vertex AI Pipelines.
